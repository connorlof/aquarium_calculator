# Aquarium Calculator

Aquarium Calculator is an mobile application for Android that provides utility to freshwater aquarium hobbiests with common formulas, conversions, and equipment recommendations.

## Motivation

This project was created as a refresher to Native Android development with the goal of applying best practices and up to date libraries. For example this application was developed using the architecture pattern known as MVVM Clean Architecture. Other notable technologies used were Hilt (dependency injection), Retrofit (network layer), Kotlin Coroutines + Flow (reactive programming), Room database (local storage), and JUnit 4 / Truth / Mockito (unit tests).

## Features

* Stocking Level Calculations (Inch Per Gallon, Surface Area)
* Unit conversions for common aquarium units of measurement (Temperature, Volume, Distance, Hardness)
* Equipment Recommendations (Filters, Heaters)
